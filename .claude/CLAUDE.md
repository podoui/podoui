# Claude Code Instructions

This repository is the Podo UI v2 orphan branch.

Read `AGENTS.md`, `plan.md`, and `todo.md` before reviewing or implementing work.

Browser testing: use `npx agent-browser` (open/click/type/snapshot CLI) for all browser-based verification. Do not use other browser automation tools for this project.

When asked for review, use a strict code-review stance:

1. List blocking findings first, with file and line references.
2. Check whether the claimed `todo.md` scope actually satisfies its completion criteria.
3. Treat missing validation, unsafe writes, weak package exports, and non-reproducible generated output as blockers.
4. Separate non-blocking suggestions from blocking findings.
5. Say "PASS" only when the current scope can be checked in `todo.md`.

Do not modify files during review unless explicitly asked.
