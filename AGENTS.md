# Agent Instructions

This repository is the `v2` orphan branch for Podo UI. Follow these instructions when working in this repository.

## Mission

Build Podo v2 as a JSON-spec-first TypeScript design system:

- Design tokens, component specs, icon metadata, themes, project overrides, builders, and MCP access are driven by validated JSON.
- The source planning documents are `plan.md` and `todo.md`.
- Work through `todo.md` in order unless the user explicitly changes priority.

## Required Workflow

1. Implement the next unchecked scope in `todo.md`.
2. Run local verification for that scope.
3. Ask both Claude Code and Agy for strict review.
4. Fix every blocking review finding.
5. Only after both reviews pass, update `todo.md` checkboxes for the completed scope.
6. Commit the passing scope.
7. Push the branch.
8. Continue to the next scope.

Do not check a task in `todo.md` before review approval. Do not commit unreviewed implementation work unless the user explicitly asks for a checkpoint commit.

## Scope Gates

Use the Phase sections in `todo.md` as the default review gate. If a Phase is too large, split it into a smaller contiguous scope and document the split in the final message or commit body.

## Branch And Git Rules

- Work on branch `v2`.
- Do not merge from `main` unless the user asks.
- You may inspect `main` with read-only commands such as `git show main:<path>`.
- Do not run destructive git commands.
- Preserve user changes.

## Project Constraints

- Use TypeScript as the default implementation language.
- Use pnpm workspaces.
- Prefer `@podo/*` scoped packages for v2.
- Keep JSON specs as the source of truth.
- Generated outputs must be reproducible from JSON specs and TypeScript source.
- Keep installed-project state inside `.podo`.
- CLI and MCP write operations must support dry-run and validation before writing.

## Quality Commands

Use these commands as the baseline when available:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm format:check
pnpm check
```

If a command cannot run because dependencies are not installed or the current phase has not implemented the required package yet, state that clearly in the review request and final update.

## Review Standard

Claude Code and Agy reviews must be strict. Ask reviewers to focus on:

- incorrect architecture decisions
- missed `todo.md` completion criteria
- broken or missing validation
- package/export/config mistakes
- generated-output reproducibility
- unsafe file writes
- migration/update risks
- test gaps that should block the current scope

Only non-blocking suggestions may remain unresolved before checking `todo.md`.

## Known Agent CLI Invocations

Use `--` before the prompt when invoking Claude Code with `--tools`; otherwise the prompt can be parsed as another tool value.

```bash
claude -p --permission-mode dontAsk --tools "Read,Grep,Bash" -- "Strictly review the current Podo v2 repository scope. Do not edit files. Return PASS only if the scope can be checked in todo.md."
```

If Claude Code tool-enabled print mode hangs in this repository, first verify the CLI itself with the safe-mode smoke command, then use safe-mode for a prompt-only review fallback.

```bash
claude -p --safe-mode --permission-mode dontAsk -- "Reply with OK only."
```

The `cc-telegram` project at `/Users/ourteam/project/cc-telegram` invokes Claude by starting `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and writing the prompt to stdin. This method was tested in this repository and should be the first fallback when `claude -p` hangs.

```bash
printf '%s' "Strictly review the current Podo v2 repository scope. Do not edit files. Return PASS only if the scope can be checked in todo.md." | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

When tool-enabled Claude print mode keeps hanging but the model itself responds, disable tools and stream the result. This works for prompt-only reviews when the prompt already includes the needed evidence; if a report file is required, manually save the returned markdown.

```bash
claude -p --safe-mode --no-session-persistence --verbose --model sonnet --tools "" --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages -- "Return a strict markdown review based only on the facts in this prompt."
```

For Agy print mode, put `--print-timeout` after the prompt.

```bash
agy --sandbox --print "Strictly review the current Podo v2 repository scope. Do not edit files. Return PASS only if the scope can be checked in todo.md." --print-timeout 10m
```

## Documentation Rules

- Keep `plan.md` as architecture intent.
- Keep `todo.md` as execution state.
- Put operational details in `docs/`.
- When the implementation diverges from `plan.md`, update the plan or document the decision before review.
